Task 3: Build a code chatbot


Goal: 

Your goal is to build a LLM powered chatbot which lets the user chat with any github repository/ codebase.

Objective:

Develop a chatbot which lets the user chat with any given github repository.
The chatbot should understand the codebase and respond to user queries appropriately.
Bonus points for implementing a hosted Gradio, Streamlit or similar interface for your chatbot.
Some helpful techniques, libraries, and frameworks that may be useful for the task include Langchain, LlamaIndex, RAG (retrieval augmented generation), Huggingface inference APIs for LLMâ€™s, etc.

Evaluation:

Your chatbot will be evaluated on the accuracy of the responses generated for any given user query related to the codebase.

Deliverables:

Well documented code with comments.
A screen recording video where you go over your code and explain details about your implementation.
Your submission files or colab notebook must be self explanatory and run without errors for evaluation
